Hi! Welcome to my space! I'm Changlong Ling, currently a first-year PhD student in the Interdisciplinary PhD Program in Urban Design and Planning at the University of Washington, Seattle. I'm passionate about developing nonparametric statistical methods and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to advance urban and transportation technologies and public policy decision-making. I'm fortunate to work with Prof. [Qing Shen](https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/people/qing-shen/) and get amazing collaboration with Prof. [Zhenhua Chen](https://knowlton.osu.edu/people/chen.7172) and Prof. [Peng Chen](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/public-affairs/people/pchen.aspx). 

Before my doctoral studies, I accumulated over five years of research experience analyzing urban dynamics using multi-source spatio-temporal big data and machine learning, as well as eight years of professional practice in urban and transportation planning and urban design. I enjoy the process of planning urban and rural spatial development, addressing real-world problems, and creating continuous values for marginalized populations and people full of longing. I studied in Wuhan and Shenzhen and did projects in Wuhan, Xuchang, Suizhou, Dongguan and Heyuan cities in China.

Research Interets
======
Urban AI: Advancing responsible, explainable, and generative AI to better urban governance for smart cities
- AI for Digital Economy: Work from Home, Urban Sustainability × Causal Machine Learning, (Spatial) Econometrics
- AI for Sustainable Mobility: Human Mobility, Sustainable Transport, & Inclusive Development × Deep Learning

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
