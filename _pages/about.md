Hi! I'm **Changlong Ling**, a first-year PhD student in the Interdisciplinary PhD Program in Urban Design and Planning at the **_University of Washington, Seattle_**, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Qing Shen](https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/people/qing-shen/). My research interests center on developing urban artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to advance automated transportation technologies and inform public policy decision-making.

Before starting my doctoral studies, I earned a master's degree in Urban and Regional Planning from Peking University, as well as dual bachelor's degrees in Economics and Urban and Rural Planning from Wuhan University. I have studied and worked in Wuhan and Shenzhen, and led several urban and transportation planning projects that were finally implemented in cities such as Wuhan, Xuchang, Suizhou, Dongguan, and Heyuan.

I view planning as a shared endeavor. I enjoy working collaboratively to address real-world challenges in urban and regional development, and to create lasting value for marginalized communities and people who dream of a smarter future. If you are interested in my work, feel free to contact me :)
