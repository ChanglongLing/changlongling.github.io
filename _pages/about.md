Hi! Welcome to my space! I'm Changlong Ling, currently a first-year PhD student in the Interdisciplinary PhD Program in Urban Design and Planning at the University of Washington, Seattle. I'm passionate about developing nonparametric statistical methods and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to advance urban and transportation technologies and public policy decision-making. I'm fortunate to work with Prof. [Qing Shen](https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/people/qing-shen/) and get amazing collaboration with Prof. [Zhenhua Chen](https://knowlton.osu.edu/people/chen.7172) and Prof. [Peng Chen](https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/public-affairs/people/pchen.aspx). 

Before my doctoral studies, I received my Bachelor's degrees in Urban-Rural Planning and Economics from Wuhan University and Master's degree in Urban and Regional Planning from Peking University in China. I accumulated over five years of research experience analyzing urban dynamics using multi-source spatio-temporal big data and machine learning, as well as eight years of professional practice in urban and transportation planning and urban design. I enjoy the process of planning urban and rural spatial development, addressing real-world problems, and creating continuous values for marginalized populations and people full of longing. I studied in Wuhan and Shenzhen and did projects in Wuhan, Xuchang, Suizhou, Dongguan and Heyuan cities in China.
