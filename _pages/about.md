Hi! I'm **Changlong Ling**, a first-year PhD student in the Interdisciplinary PhD Program in Urban Design and Planning at the **_University of Washington, Seattle_**, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Qing Shen](https://urbdp.be.uw.edu/people/qing-shen/). I'm interested in developing artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and statistical/data science methods to support the integration of automated vehicles into urban mobility systems. My research seeks to enhance the economic effectiveness, systematic smartness, and environmental sustainability of future transportation, ultimately informing equitable public policies.

I hold a master's degree in Urban Planning from Peking University, as well as dual bachelor's degrees in Economics and Urban Planning from Wuhan University. I have led several urban and transportation planning projects that were finally implemented in cities such as Wuhan, Xuchang, Suizhou, Dongguan, and Heyuan.

I view planning as a shared endeavor. I enjoy working collaboratively to address real-world challenges in urban and regional development, and to create lasting values for marginalized communities and people who dream of a smarter future. If you are interested in my work, feel free to contact me :)
